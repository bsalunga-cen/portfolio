    <p>I am Bianca, a Filipino soul seasoned in Singapore's spice, now embracing the Canadian chill -- I'm an international student in Software Engineering Technician at Centennial College.</p>
<p>
Embracing new horizons while I'm navigating my first Canadian adventure, all the way from Singapore's bustling streets. Still pinching myself, but loving every minute of it!
</p>
<p>
When I'm not diving into my studies, you'll find me cooking delicious recipes, capturing the world through my lens, or exploring new corners of the globe.
</p>
<p>Come along for the ride! ðŸ˜Š</p>
